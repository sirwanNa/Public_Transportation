Smart Public Transportation with Hyperledger Fabric

This repository contains the source code and components of my Master's thesis project at the University of Tehran. The goal of the project was to design and implement a blockchain-based platform for managing public transportation in a smart city environment. Leveraging Hyperledger Fabric as the private distributed ledger, the system includes a Decentralized Application (DApp) and smart contracts to support secure and transparent operations.

Key features of the project include:

    Implementation of a DApp for user interaction

    Development of smart contracts for managing transportation data

    Evaluation of distributed system parameters such as latency, consensus algorithm behavior, and fault tolerance probability
