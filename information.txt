This is a project for running some subsystems of public transportation under a hyperledger fabric blockchain.
It includes both application and smart contracts. the application was implemented with typescript and smart contracts were implemented by node.js.
I created this project for analyzing and testing a private blockchain for public transportation in a smart city for my master's dissertation at the University of Tehran.
The subsystems that have been considered here are 
1-Stops(Stations) Management
2-Rout(Line) Management
3-Travel management
4-Ticket Management
5-Repairing Service Management
6-Pollution Management
7-Line Entrance Management
